Calculations using CASSCF/cc-pVDZ for geometries and vibrational frequencies. Energies of reactats, products and TS computed with CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ extrapolated to complete basis set using MP2/aug-cc-pVnZ(n=2,3,4). Rate founded with conventional TST. Error in barrier at most 2 kcal/mol, likely about 1 kcal/mol.
